The main reason I created this configuration is to make my system easily reproducible. I particularly enjoy minimalist, clean, and highly productive setups. This repository reflects my desire for an environment that is simple to replicate, while remaining elegant and efficient.

I've created a script (`install.sh`) that allows for a quick installation of my work environment, as well as backup and restoration capabilities.
